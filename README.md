### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anna, a senior studying biochemistry and data science at the University of Notre Dame. I'm excited about streamlining medical research and improving healthcare outcomes with computational tools! In my free time, I love to create new playlists, add to my miniature spoon collection, or read mystery novels.
